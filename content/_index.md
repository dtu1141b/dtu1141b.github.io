I am currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in B.E. Computer Science at [BITS Pilani - Pilani Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), where I am in my second year. My academic curiosity lies at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, mathematics, and competitive programming**, though it might change in future.    
<br/>
Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved with the [Mathematics Association](https://maths-assoc-bits-pilani.github.io/), where I serve as **Research Team Lead**. In this role, I organize events such as *Integration Bee* and *Proving the Obvious*, while mentoring junior members of the Research Team. Outside of academics and programming, I enjoy reading novels and watching anime.
